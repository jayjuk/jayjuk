- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jayjuk
- ðŸ‘€ I am not full-time professional software engineer, but have recently resumed programming in my spare time. I am passionate about coding and any projects you find here are likely to be largely driven by my desire to continue learning and having fun.
- ðŸŒ± I use Python, SQL and many third party products at work; in my spare time, I have recently started learning Rust.
