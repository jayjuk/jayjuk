- 👋 Hi, I’m @jayjuk
- 👀 I am not full-time professional software engineer, but have recently resumed programming in my spare time. I am passionate about coding and any projects you find here are likely to be largely driven by my desire to continue learning and having fun.
- 🌱 I use Python, SQL and many third party products at work; in my spare time, I have recently started learning Rust.
